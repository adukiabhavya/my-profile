<p>
    My vision is to work at a managerial position at a reputed multinational company and create a seamless blend among the factors that require smooth operation of an organization thereby making an impression in the applicable sector.
Being born and brought up in a family of knowledgeable entrepreneurs, the spirit of business has been inbuilt in my DNA.I have been blessed enough to be an essential part of business-oriented discussions, which has built up my inborn motivation to run after this field and implanted in me certain essential aspects involving business, such as forward planning and calculated thinking. ></p>

<h2>Work experience💼</h2>
<p>
    I have comprehended that business is a combination of comprehensible communication, calculative actions and accurate problem-solving, all of which I have aimed to gather through an array of activities in school and elsewhere. In order to acquaint myself with the implication of academic knowledge, I have taken part in the workings of my family business AIC Steel Pvt Ltd for the past 7 months and trained myself in the various paths of organization by interning under the marketing team.

<h2>Social service🤝 </h2>
<p>
    Visiting Marwaari Relief Society Hospital, and interacting with physically challenged and giving financial aid to underprivileged children having Cerebral Palsy, for the first time opened my eyes to see how management is important in all sectors of society. Management is a major part of each industry be it hospitality in NGOs or managing a big business enterprise.</p>
